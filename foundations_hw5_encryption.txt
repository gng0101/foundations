Homework for Week 5


1)      ssh to your server, download a file to your laptop from there (using scp), and put a new file on your server (using either scp or wget)

I ssh to my server using scp to transfer files back and forth between my local machine and my remote server.


2)      write a short account of your experience

I had a bit of trouble trying to do this because I thought I needed to create a new ssh key like we did for Github, but as it turns out, I only need to find the original key I created on the
first day for AWS.  It was a fairly silly mistake, but I was eventually able to figure it out with a little help in class.  Then I had some issues transferring files from my remote server to
my local machine, but I eventually realized that I need to take a series of steps, including:

a) changing the permissions on my key (.pem) using chmod 600 key.pem to provide read/write privileges for the key to the user

b) from my local machine, enter the entire path and file of my key.pem, location of my source file, and the location of my destination file.
I used the following command from my Documents directory: scp -i ~/Documents/key.pem admin@remote_public_ip:~/notebooks/mynewhomework.py ~/Documents/Lede

c) confirmed that mynewhomework.py was in my ~/Documents/Lede directory on my local machine.

To transfer a file from my ~/Documents/Lede directory on my local machine to my ~/temp directory on my remote server, I took the following steps:

a) creating a sample file to transfer using touch foobar.txt within my local ~/Documents/Lede directory

b) from my local machine, using the following command from my Documents directory: scp -i ~/Documents/key.pem ~/Documents/Lede/foobar.txt admin@remote_public_ip:~/temp

c) confirmed that my foobar.txt file was in my ~/temp directory on my remote server.


Creating an SSH key along with a passphrase for an added layer of security was very technical, as I did not understand some of the modifying attributes to the key generation commands, but I $

3)      send an encrypted message to a classmmate using PGP/GPG

Sent a message to Ilia using his public key.
